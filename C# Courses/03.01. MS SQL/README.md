# MS SQL

This course will provide the necessary introduction to one of the most widely used database management systems used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course pays attention to the relational model, the modeling of data with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, connections, aggregation, grouping, change, delete and insert). Fundamental knowledge of ACID transactions and transaction processing is provided. This course lays the foundations for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications.
