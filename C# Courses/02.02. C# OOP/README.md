# C# OOP

The course focuses on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, applying object-oriented modeling, and building hierarchies of classes. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism shall be studied in depth. In addition, a specific focus shall be paid to the most commonly used design templates (creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns). The SOLID principles for object-oriented software design shall be one of the main focuses of this course. Attention will be paid to the different debugging techniques, the component testing (unit tests), and the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
