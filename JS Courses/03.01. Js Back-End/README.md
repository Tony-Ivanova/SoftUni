# JS Back-End 

The course aims to provide basic knowledge on the development of JavaScript server-side applications using Node.js and Express.js. During the course, a specific focus will be placed upon the creation of a Node.js server, the development of a server-client architecture, and the easiest and fastest way for creating data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, using modern techniques and tools. Towards the end of the course, a complete REST API will be built from scratch, using Express.js and MongoDB.
