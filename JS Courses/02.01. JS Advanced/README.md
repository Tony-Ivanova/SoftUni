# JS Advanced 

The course focuses on the more complicated programming concepts such as arrays, functions, objects and classes. A specific emphasis is laid on the function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course shall provide the basic skills to work with the DOM tree, to perfome simple manipulations with it as well as to handle events. Information with regards to the OOP way of programming in JavaScript shall be given, as well as details regarding the inheritance, object composition Ð¸ prototype chain.
