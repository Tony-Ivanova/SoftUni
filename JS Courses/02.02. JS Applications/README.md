# JS Applications

A specific emphasis is placed on the HTTP request and how to use them. Additionally, basic knowledge regarding REST Services, BAAS (backend as a service), asynchronous code, templating and routing is being provided. During the course a SPA app is created so as to practice the concepts learned during the lectures.
